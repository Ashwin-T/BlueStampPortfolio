# Smart Mirror by Ashwin T
My project is building and coding a Smart Mirror from scratch. The Smart Mirror is a mirror with a display behind it allowing it to show different components onto the screen. I am using a Rasberry Pi to run and display the code I have written. I wrote the code using React and numerous other JavaScript libraries incuding Moment.js and Electron.js, which allows the program to run as an application on a Linux operating system. I also used other node modules and APIs including the spotify API and OpenWeather API to display real time data. I hope to use my Smart Mirror to managa and organize my busy life.

# First Milestone

My first milestone was setting up a Rasberry Pi and starting coding the display using React. I downloaded the Raspbian OS software onto the Pi using an SD card and set up the rest of the components inculding heatsinks, mouse and keyboard compoenents, and a display. With that part completed I started working on the code. I learned what Electron.js was and how it allows for code to be run as an application on Linux based operating systems. I used React to customize my components and was able to code a clock which updates in real time using Moment.js. I also learned how to work with aysnc functions and connected to APIs. Although implementing all my APIs is my second milestone, I got a little ahead and was able to display the current weather using the OpenWeather API which updates in realtime!
